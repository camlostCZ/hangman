# HANGMAN

A famous word-guessing game.

This implementation is just a small project to entertain my kids. ;-)

## Usage

```
hangman.py [filename]
```
The *filename* file should contain a list of 'secret' words,
each on a new line.

If no filename is passed as an argument, 'words.txt' is used.

### Notes

The words.txt file contains words in Czech.
